### ResMLP Mnist Report, Wei Pan (潘炜)
I will implement MLP with residual learning. I want to implement the model from Meta's paper[ResMLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03404) on Mnist Dataset. By the way, resnet is simple and beautiful. Also thanks to Kaiming He's Resnet [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).  And I conduct some ablation study to prove correctness of my network implemetation .

because `.ipynb` or jupyter notebook is so slow and inefficient. I will use `.py` to implement the model.
